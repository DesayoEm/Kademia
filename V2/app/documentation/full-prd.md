# Academic Management System (AMS)
## Product Requirements Document

### Project Overview
The Academic Management System (AMS) is designed to manage student records, academic performance, and school operations for a secondary school environment. The system handles student information, course management, grade calculations, and academic workflows with proper security and scalability.

### System Architecture

#### Backend Stack
- Framework: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- Authentication: JWT + OAuth2
- File Storage: Cloud storage (S3 or similar) for documents and images
- Cache: Redis for session management


### Key Features & Implementation Notes

#### Phase 1: Core System
1. **Student Management**
   - Basic CRUD operations for student records
   - Class assignment and department tracking
   - Document management (report cards, certificates)

2. **Academic Structure**
   - Classes 1-3: General education, no departments
   - Classes 4-6: Department-based (Science, Business, Humanities)
   - Subject assignment based on class level and department

3. **Grade Management**
   - Term-wise grade recording
   - File attachments for physical exam papers
   - Class position calculation
   - Report generation
   - View all remarks

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. **Attendance Tracking**
2. **Homework Management**
3. **Timetable System**
4. **Parent Communication Portal**
5. Parent-teacher-student appointment scheduling

### API Endpoints Structure

#### Authentication
```
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/refresh
POST /auth/logout
```

#### Student Management
```
GET /students
POST /students
GET /students/{id}
PUT /students/{id}
DELETE /students/{id}
```

#### Academic Records
