# error_map

# Maps entity models to error metadata used in dynamic exception handling.
# Format: ModelClass â†’ (model_class, user-facing display_name)
#
# Used by service factories to:
# - Raise EntityNotFoundError, ArchiveDependencyError, etc.
# - Provide user-facing names in error messages
#
# REQUIRED for all models using dynamic exception logic
# If missing, Kademia will crash while attempting to raise an exception.

# Example:
#     Student: (Student, "Student")

from ...database.models import *
from ..errors import *

# Entity: entity_model, display_name
