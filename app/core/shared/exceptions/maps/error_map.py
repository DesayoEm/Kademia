"""error_map

Maps entity models to error metadata used in dynamic exception handling.
Format: ModelClass â†’ (model_class, identity-facing display_name)

Used by service factories to:
- Raise EntityNotFoundError, ArchiveDependencyError, etc.
- Provide identity-facing names in error messages

REQUIRED for all models using dynamic exception logic
If missing, Kademia will crash while attempting to raise an exception.

Example:
    Student: (Student, "Student")
